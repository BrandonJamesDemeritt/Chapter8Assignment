(1) Prompt the user to input five pairs of numbers: A player's jersey number (0 - 99) and the player's rating (1 - 9). 
Store the jersey numbers and the ratings in a dictionary. Output the dictionary's elements with the jersey numbers in ascending order 
(i.e., output the roster from smallest to largest jersey number). Hint: Dictionary keys can be stored in a sorted list.

(2) Implement a menu of options for a user to modify the roster. Each option is represented by a single character. 
The program initially outputs the menu, and outputs the menu after a user chooses an option. 
The program ends when the user chooses the option to Quit. For this step, the other options do nothing.

(3) Implement the "Output roster" menu option.

(4) Implement the "Add player" menu option. Prompt the user for a new player's jersey number and rating. Append the values to the two vectors.

(5) Implement the "Delete player" menu option. Prompt the user for a player's jersey number. 
Remove the player from the roster (delete the jersey number and rating).

(6) Implement the "Update player rating" menu option. Prompt the user for a player's jersey number. 
Prompt again for a new rating for the player, and then change that player's rating.

(7) Implement the "Output players above a rating" menu option. Prompt the user for a rating. 
Print the jersey number and rating for all players with ratings above the entered value.
